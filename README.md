# Dawn of Man

This is the pre-Alpha version of my roguelike game.  I started working on this in order to develop my Python coding skills.  Eventually I decided that I wanted to focus my energy on Javascript instead since I was fairly comfortable with Python.  So I have stopped working on this for now.  It is not really worth playing at the moment but I am leaving this here in case I ever want to develop this.  This game started from a project created by TStand90 (who in turn adapted something made by Jo√£o F. Henriques).

The game required Python 3.5 or higher and is using the TCOD and LIBTCODPY modules.

Tile set is taken from the DawnLike Tileset and is created by DawnBringer.  It is covered by the CC-BY 4.0 license.
